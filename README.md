# Favourite Pet App

This is an Ionic app that allows you to choose your favourite dog pictures.

## Get Started

First you will need the latest version of the Ionic CLI 

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Ensure dependencies are installed by running 

```
npm install
```

To run in the browser you can use the following command

```
ionic serve
```

## If I had more time

My Ionic proved to be pretty rusty so I ran out of time but I would add the following improvements if I had longer:

* improved form validation to make sure error messages are relevant and disable the form submission if no dogs are selected
* add unit and feature tests to make sure functionality continues to do as it is expected
* improve A11y by ensuring images have more better alt text
* update images so we load in the sizes we need to improve performance
* move the lists into a component and improve how the styles are handled
* build and test on native devices
* add a better app icon
